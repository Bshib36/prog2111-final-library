## Project Overview
Our project is a Library Management System that stores information about books, 
their copies, members, and librarians. It lets the library track when a member borrows
a specific book copy and when it is returned. Each book also has details like category,
publisher, and language. This helps the library stay organized by keeping records, loans, and staff activity.
